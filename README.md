#### Virtual-Screening
  * **ligand-3D-conformations**  
[prepare_for_docking.py](https://github.com/Team-SKI/snippets/blob/master/Structural%20bioinformatics/prepare_for_docking.py): Script that uses Open Babel to generate 3D structures of compounds.    
For usage info run `prepare_for_docking.py -h`

  * **filtering**  
[filter_pains.py](https://github.com/Team-SKI/snippets/blob/master/Cheminformatics/Screening/filter_pains.py): Script that uses RDKit to remove PAINS compounds from sdf or smile files.  
For usage info run `filter_pains.py -h`
